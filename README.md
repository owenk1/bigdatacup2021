# bigdatacup2021

This repository contains my submission for the 2021 Big Data Cup, facilitated by Stathletes. Here you will find my final report, key image outputs (including option maps and passing danger tiers), and a sample of the Python code I used to conduct my analysis and produce my graphics. Note that since this competition I've refined my approach to building models - for an up-to-date demonstration of what I can do, please consult my 'Hockey Model Code Samples' repository.  

The final report PDF is named 'Owen_Kewell_Big_Data_Cup_Final_Submission'. Each image uploaded separately is also found in this report.

Feel free to contact me on Twitter (@owenkewell) with any feedback, comments, or questions.

Thanks - I hope you enjoy!
Owen
