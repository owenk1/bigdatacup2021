# bigdatacup2021

This repository contains my submission for the 2021 Big Data Cup, facilitated by Stathletes. Here you will find my final report, key image outputs (including option maps and passing danger tiers), and a sample of the Python code I used to conduct my analysis and produce my graphics.  

The final report PDF is named 'Owen_Kewell_Big_Data_Cup_Final_Submission'. Each image uploaded separately is also found in this report.

Feel free to contact me on Twitter (@owenkewell) with any feedback, comments, or questions.

Thanks - I hope you enjoy!
Owen
