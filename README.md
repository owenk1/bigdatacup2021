# bigdatacup2021

This repository contains my submission for the 2021 Big Data Cup, including my final report and images of key passing maps. A subset of my Python code and key data outputs will be uploaded soon once I've completed their aggregation and cleaning. 

The final report PDF is named 'Owen_Kewell_Big_Data_Cup_Final_Submission'. Each image uploaded separately is also found in this report.

Feel free to contact me on Twitter (@owenkewell) with any feedback, comments, or questions.
