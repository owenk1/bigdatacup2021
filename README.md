# bigdatacup2021

This repository contains my submission for the 2021 Big Data Cup, facilitated by Stathletes. Here you will find my final report and key image outputs, including option maps and passing danger tiers. A subset of my Python code and key data outputs will be uploaded soon once I've completed their aggregation and cleaning. 

The final report PDF is named 'Owen_Kewell_Big_Data_Cup_Final_Submission'. Each image uploaded separately is also found in this report.

Feel free to contact me on Twitter (@owenkewell) with any feedback, comments, or questions.
